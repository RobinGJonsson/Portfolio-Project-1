                    <p>Hop on your stationary bike at home and join us for a ride! Just sitting on the stationary bike and pedaling
                        can get extremly boring extremly fast, it is also difficult to push yourself to the max when you're 
                        just blindly pedaling. That's why we have this online spinning class for you to boost the fun and the motivation
                        so that pedaling on the stationary bike will actually be something you enjoy.
